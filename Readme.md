## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of several machine learning techniques and deep learning models using Python. The goal is to provide a comprehensive example of how to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Techniques Implemented

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used to predict a target variable based on one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

### Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

### Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Support Vector Classifier is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.

## Deep Learning Models

### Digit Classification
A deep learning model built to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy.

### Movie Rating Classification
A deep learning model built to classify movie ratings based on text reviews using a given dataset. This model employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTM layers to handle sequential data.

## Datasets

- **MNIST Dataset**: Used for digit classification.
- **Movie Reviews Dataset**: Used for movie rating classification.
